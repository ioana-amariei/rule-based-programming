The development of Web applications has changed with the popu-
larity of RIA (AJAX, Flash, FLEX).
Howerver from the UI accesibility point of view this techologies are rather challeing.
The design of UI in Web could be approached by a model-based method.
In the last years the complexity of Web applications has increased segnificantly.;
But this RIA is somewhat not permitede in all situatuins (e.g blind people).

SAW  offers accesibility to the Web for people with special needs by the use of ontologies.
HTML element are annotated with special semantic elements, witch can be used to contruct an ontology.

RUX
In RUX the takdowns is rather different.
We need to provide an abstract UI that provides the features that are common to al the RIA devices and platform.
With this abstraction in back we provide a view for each type of person/device we want.

Another step is combining the two models.
